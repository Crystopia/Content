# Welcome Back

<br /><br />

Hey there! We're so glad you're here.  
Today, we're super excited to introduce the new **Crystopia Website** – a fresh, modern, and fully **open source** project that’s more than just code.

<br />
<br />

## 🚀 Our Roadmap: What’s Coming?

<br /><br />

We’ve got big plans ahead – here are the first two milestones:

- **☁️ Crystopia Cloud**  
  A central platform to smartly manage your projects, data, and tools. Fast, lightweight, and of course privacy-friendly.

- **📦 Resourcepack Manager**  
  No more complicated RP setups! Our manager will make it easy to create, combine, and manage Minecraft resource packs – locally or through the cloud.

- **⚙️ More Plugins**  
  We’re also working on more plugins like RoleLink, CrystalRewards, AffiliateCode, CrystalShardAPI, etc.  
  These will continue to be developed and released on [modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com/organization/xyzspace)

## 💡 Open Source

Crystopia is **freely available on GitHub**.  
We’ve decided to host all of our projects on GitHub to make development more transparent and collaborative.  
Everyone is welcome to contribute, share feedback, or simply see what we’re up to.
