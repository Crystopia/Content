# Welcome back

Hey there! Glad to have you here.  
We are thrilled to present the new **Crystopia website** today – a fresh, modern and completely **open source** project that is more than just code.

---

## 🚀 Our roadmap: What's coming?

We have big plans, and here are two of the first milestones:

- **☁️ Crystopia Cloud**
A central platform where you can manage your projects, data and tools smartly. Fast, lightweight and, of course, privacy-friendly.

- **📦 Resourcepack Manager**
No more complicated RP setups! Our manager will make it easy to create, combine and manage Minecraft resource packs – locally or via the cloud.

- **⚙️ More plugins**
  We are also working on additional plugins such as RoleLink, CrystalRewards, AffilietCode, CrystalShardAPI, etc. We will continue to develop these in the coming months and will also publish them on [modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com/organization/xyzspace).

Everyone is invited to contribute, give feedback or just see what we are up to.
